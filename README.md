#### requires
[The Bootstrap Package](https://github.com/benjaminkott/bootstrap_package) where it (for sakes of the get-it-done-asap) 
overwrites one of the default templates - DEFAULT SUBNAVIGATION 2 COLUMNS. This will/should be changed one day.  
  
#### use it   
* Get the Bootstrap Package extension.  
* Copy the two directories into your installation root (it will overwrite some of the default BS package files).  
* Create an extension typoscript setup in the backend, paste in the setup.txt content  
* In page appearance choose the backend layout **Default, Subnavigation left and 2 column**  
* Fill in the boxes with text/images content for the tile  
* Add thumbs, 50x50, as plain HTML  
* Upload big images for the backgrounds to the respective box. Use the typo3 backend content type Images, images must be in the order of the thumbs.
